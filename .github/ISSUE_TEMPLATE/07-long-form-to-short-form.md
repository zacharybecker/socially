Optionally support one-click (or guided) creation of multiple scheduled posts from the generated clips across selected platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inputs: URL, pasted text, or transcript upload.
- [ ] AI output: hooks + 30–60s segment suggestions.
- [ ] Optional flow to schedule multiple posts across platforms.
