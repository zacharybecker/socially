## Description
Use analytics data (from cross-platform analytics) to rank and surface best-performing posts, clips, and platforms (e.g. top posts by engagement, best platform for a given metric).

Expose this in the UI (e.g. Analytics or a “Top content” section) with filters by platform, date range, and metric.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Ranking logic based on engagement and selected metrics.
- [ ] UI surfaces top posts/clips/platforms with filters.
- [ ] Metrics sourced from analytics endpoints.
